```

## Installation and Running

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Development Notes

### Backend API Integration
The frontend connects to backend API through Vite proxy configuration:
- Development environment: `/api/*` proxies to `http://localhost:5000`
- Ensure backend service is running on port 5000

### Speech Features
- Uses Web Speech API for speech recognition
- Supports Chinese speech recognition
- Requires user microphone permission

### Accessibility Design
- Large font and high contrast design
- Simplified operation flow
- Optimized for elderly users

## Next Steps

1. **Speech-to-text functionality**: Implement complete voice recording and conversion workflow
2. **Memory card CRUD**: Complete create, edit, delete functionality
3. **Search and filtering**: Add memory card search functionality
4. **Reminder system**: Integrate reminder functionality
5. **Data persistence**: Complete API integration with backend

## Notes

- Speech recognition requires HTTPS environment (production)
- Some browsers may not support Web Speech API
- Requires user microphone permission
